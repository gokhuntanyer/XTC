180419-TestHRIR: My S and A sucks. I tried to normalize them with CENTER,
used Farina's method. Did not work. Did not try minphase/excessphase.

180404-testSandA: convolve S and A to simulate the listening scenario. 
Did not work.

180401-mpHRTF: use S and A to implement Farina's XLR network. Used AmpESS 
and Cuban. Did not work.

180225: create 10X2 pulses LEFT/R
create stfilter and tsfilter
measure peak times, PRI and filter HRIR LEFT/R.
